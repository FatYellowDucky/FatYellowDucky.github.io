# scss & css<br>
why have a folder for scss and css<br>
why that's for my computer memory<br>
one scss file need's one other file<br>
to get compiled and used. im not<br>
going to delete one file for all the<br>
scss file's so just have scss and plain css<br>
is good enough<br>
for stuff like the wiki button
# when i use scss and plain css<br>
i use scss for stuff like big page's and the
index<br>
file. like there is<br>
pybot.scss<br>
404.scss<br>
style.scss<br>
help.scss<br>
and<br>
JsJson.scss<br>

the css folder<br>
has one file<br>
right now but<br>
im going to add more<br>
file's to the css folder
